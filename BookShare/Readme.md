# BookShare Platform

## Overview
BookShare is a microservices-based application that enables users to upload, browse, and view book details. The platform is designed using a modular architecture to ensure scalability, maintainability, and easy deployment.

### Key Features
- **Frontend**: Developed using React to provide a user-friendly interface.
- **Backend**: Built with Flask to handle API requests and business logic.
- **Database**: Uses PostgreSQL to store book data and user information.
- **Microservices Architecture**: Each component operates independently, making the system modular and scalable.

---

## What is Microservices?
Microservices is an architectural style that structures an application as a collection of loosely coupled, independently deployable services. Each service corresponds to a specific functionality, such as the frontend, backend, or database in the BookShare application.

### Benefits of Microservices:
- **Scalability**: Each service can be scaled independently based on its demand.
- **Maintainability**: Smaller codebases are easier to manage and test.
- **Flexibility**: Services can be updated or replaced without affecting others.
- **Fault Isolation**: Issues in one service do not bring down the entire system.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **Docker** and **Docker Compose** installed on your machine.
- Basic knowledge of React, Flask, and PostgreSQL.

### Steps to Run the Application
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd my-micro-app
   ```

2. **Set Up Environment Variables**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
   - Add required environment variables for the backend and database (e.g., database username, password, and host).

3. **Build and Start Services**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up --build
   ```

4. **Access the Application**:
   - Frontend: `http://localhost:3000`
   - Backend API: `http://localhost:5000`

## Service Details

### Frontend
- **Path**: `frontend/`
- **Technology**: React
- **Description**: Provides a user-friendly interface to browse, upload, and view book details.

### Backend
- **Path**: `backend/`
- **Technology**: Flask
- **Description**: Handles API requests, processes data, and communicates with the database.

### Database
- **Path**: `db/`
- **Technology**: PostgreSQL
- **Description**: Stores book details, user information, and other application data.

---

## Working of the Application
1. **Frontend**:
   - Users interact with the application via the React-based UI.
   - The frontend sends API requests to the backend for operations like fetching book data or uploading a new book.

2. **Backend**:
   - Receives API requests from the frontend.
   - Processes the requests and communicates with the PostgreSQL database to retrieve or store data.
   - Returns the processed data to the frontend.

3. **Database**:
   - Stores persistent data such as book information, user details, and other records.
   - Initializes with the schema defined in `db/init.sql`.

---

## Deployment
- **Frontend**: Deployed on Netlify.
- **Backend**: Deployed on Render.
- **Database**: Hosted using a managed PostgreSQL service or containerized for local development.

---

## Future Enhancements
- Implement user authentication and authorization.
- Add search and filtering features for books.
- Enable user reviews and ratings for books.
- Optimize performance for large datasets.
